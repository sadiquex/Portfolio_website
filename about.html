    <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio. I am a graphic designer who absolutely loves to explore the capabilities 
    of my imagination. This profile shows some of my work from my design major and Photography minor projects which I
    have been on since the beginning of 2021. Creating digital contents is something which interests me and I am
    constantly finding ways to improve my knowledge in the field.</p>
    <br>

    As you will see in my Portfolio, I enjoy working with colours and shapes and also enjoy using different styles
    for each project I do. I always hope to upgrade the levels in my work and I hope for each project to be approached
    with a completely different and fresh approach, something which has not yet been done.
    <br>
    I absolutely love figuring things out and can sit for a long time exploring the tools I use such as the Adobe Suite
    and others.
    <br>Please enjoy my digital portfolio and follow up to see my creative content!<br>
